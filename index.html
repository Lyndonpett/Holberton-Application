            <h3 class="index">What do you normally think of when you think about parrots?</h3>
            <p>If you think of colorful birds that are riding on a pirate's shoulder, you'd be partly right. Parrots have been companions of humans dating all the way back to 400 B.C.. Now, they span the globe and are living in millions of households all
                across the world. There are still many that live in the wild and mostly live in warm climates. However, there are a few exceptions, like the kea, which live in the alpine regions of New Zealand. How do you classify a bird as a parrot?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parrots must have a curved beak.</li>
                <li>Parrots have zygodactyl feet. (which means two forward and two backward facing toes)</li>
                <li>Parrots are not mammals.</li>
            </ul>



            <h2 class="index">Why do parrots make great pets?</h2>
            <h3 class="index">Parrots are the best companions, espcially for stay at home work.</h3>
            <p>Parrots are extremely intelligent and interact with you in a way no other pet does. It's been estimated that some parrots have the same intelligence levels and reasoning skills as a seven year old child. Parrots also live an extremely long
                time for how small they can be and will be a lifelong companion in some cases. Their personalities vary from bird to bird and will have different quirks that will keep owning them fun and entertaining. They will typically bond to one person
                and will become inseparable putting all of their tiny little heart into loving you. Parrots are somewhat of an exotic pet and will attract attention and spark coversation with others. </p>



            <h2 class="index">Why do parrots not make good pets?</h2>
            <h3 class="index">Parrots require a lifestyle change of sacrifice.</h3>
            <p>While parrots bond with one person, there can be problems in this. Parrots might lash out of others for being around "their person". They are still wild animals at heart. Some can be hard to train and result in never being tame or well mannered.
                You must be careful on which scents you have in your home, as parrots have very sensitive respritory systems and can become sick from strong smells. Pans you cook with cannot have any Teflon, because again, their respritory systems cannot
                handle the fumes like other pets. Parrots are a very big time commitment. They must be out of their cage for hours everyday, so that they stay happy and healthy. The age parrots live can also be a problem, because 20+ years for the smaller
                species is a major life decision. </p>



            <h2 class="index">The goods outweigh the bad.</h2>
            <h3 class="index">Parrots can be the center of your life, providing joy and happiness.</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, parrots can be the most rewarding pets you will ever have the pleasure of befriending. But as amazing as they are, itâ€™s important to keep in mind that parrots are not for everyone. Though they can be your best friend, they also
                require a great deal of time and attention. You should only get a parrot if you can be fair to them and have ample time to dedicate to them each and every day. </p>
